# Introduction to developing for OS X: Getting Started

## Introduction
- What is OS X?
- Why would you want to develop for it?
- Apple makes it easy
- Outline this article

## Prerequisites
- Mac
- OS X
- An AppleID

## Obtaining Tools
- Only _need_ Xcode
- Download from the app store
- _Maybe_ How to get beta versions?

## Xcode

- IDE - actually a collection of different tools all lumped together
- How to open a downloaded example

### Creating a new app

- Different app types
- Walkthrough creating your first app

### Running your app

- Using the play button

### Code Editor

- Integrate some really simple code
- Build and run to show the difference

### Interface Builder

- Mention storyboards.
- Make a simple change - see it work
- Throw forward to the Building UI tutorial

### Asset Catalog

- Store for assets
- Includes metadata about usage
- Add something to the catalog

### Debugging

- Explain what debugging is (very high level)
- Add a breakpoint
- Debug, show it stopped
- Look at variable values
- Continue
- Nothing more advanced

### Instruments

- Important part of preparing an app for production
- Demonstrate how to start it
- List some of the more useful instruments
- Demonstrate example (e.g. time profiler)
- Don't go into any detail

### Testing

- Another important part of the software engineering process
- Once again baked into Xcode
- Demonstrate where tests live & how to run them

### Documentation

- Built in tooltip for code view
- Documentation browser
- How to download docs

### Playgrounds

- Recent addition
- Standalone, or within a project
- Show one in

### Distribution

- Mention that it's build into Xcode
- Give tips about how to begin

## Where to go from here?
- Next tutorial will be "Anatomy of an app"
- Links to some of Apple's docs
