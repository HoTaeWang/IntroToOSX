# Introduction to developing for OS X: Building a UI

## Introduction
- UI very important
- Should build as much as possible in Storyboards
- Outline

## Prerequisites

- OS X
- Xcode
- Link to tooling

## Laying out a scene
- Very quick intro to Auto Layout
- Demonstration of doc outline
- Preview assistant
- Link to our iOS video series

## Interacting with the UI with code
- Create an outlet and link to it
- Using code to change it
- Create an IBAction
- Create a handler method

## Multiple Scenes
- Adding another scene to the Storyboard
- Creating a segue between them
- Linking to the (prewritten) view controller

## Editing the menu (maybe?)
- Change some options in the menu within the storyboard


## Where to go from here
- Summarise what you've learnt in these tutorials
- Mention that we'll have loads of new content as part of the OS X team
- Link to Apple's documentation
